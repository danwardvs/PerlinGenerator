# PerlinGenerator
Generates a basic Perlin noise image with a few basic paramaters.

Basic features are:
- Generate X by Y image and saves as .png
- Control the octave count used to generate the noise
- Choose between solid or transparent background

# Dependencies

I use 5.2 but any version should work
